One of the technologies that makes underwater communication possible is the transmission of data across the ocean via underwater wireless sensor networks (UWSN). These developments raise issues with the UWSN's security. Secure neighbour finding for effective information exchange is a challenge in such a system since the movement of the nodes is unpredictable. A neighborship attack is one that prevents network nodes from finding each other's neighbours. The two assaults that stand out in this category, the wormhole and Sybil attacks, cause a variety of problems if not addressed. These attacks can have a wide range of negative effects, from decreased throughput to secrecy loss.Moreover, due to limitations on the open acoustic channel and challenging underwater settings, traditional cryptographic techniques cannot be implemented in a UWSN.

For the purpose of preventing neighborship attacks in UWSN, we suggest a true-neighbour algorithm. Additionally, UnetStack is used to show how well the method performs in terms of end-to-end packet delay both with and without the algorithm's implementation.
With the Unet project, networking of underwater bodies is achievable. To operate each Unet node that facilitates communication over links, UnetStack software is necessary. Application Programming Interfaces (API) are necessary for communication. Languages like Java, Groovy, Python, and Javascript support the UnetStack API.
